My name is Purevbadral but I prefer to be called "**Binbin** (ë¹ˆë¹ˆ, å½¬å½¬)".
I am a undergraduate student at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) majoring in Industrial and Systems Engineering. 
My academic interests lie in the digital transformation, automation, and digital twin. 
I am also interested in the field of business studies. 

As I initially wanted to study medicine and throughout my high school years, I was very passionate about chemistry and biology, which led me to participate in national and international level olympiads. 
After my freshman year at KAIST, I was a undergraduate researcher at one of the chemistry labs at KAIST. 
However, I realized that my passion lies in the field of industry, where I can tackle with random processes and systems.
