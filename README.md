My name is Purevbadral ([pʲʰurʲĕw̜bădrăɮ]) but I prefer to be called "**Binbin** (빈빈, 彬彬)".
## About Me
I am a undergraduate student at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) majoring in Industrial and Systems Engineering.

🔍 **Academic Interests**:
* Automatization
* Business studies
* Digital transformation
* Digital twin

## Background

As I initially wanted to study medicine and throughout my high school years, I was very passionate about chemistry and biology, which led me to participate in national and international level olympiads. 
After my freshman year at KAIST, I was a undergraduate researcher at one of the chemistry labs at KAIST. 
However, I realized that my passion lies in the field of industry, where I can tackle with random processes and systems.
